FOX Voting Simulator

<p>
In primaries, it is important to get the most attention. With 12 candidates all sharing the stage, it can be hard to pull in voters. Luckily Mr Trump doesn't have much problem with that, but we have a strategy to secure the vote for good. We have found voters respond very well to name recognition, and which ever candidate is polling the highest. We see a snowball effect if we can tip a few online polls his way, then it will be easier for him to take the real ones, and then eventually the nomination.

We were able to dump some of the source code from FOX's new online poll service. We couldn't get everything, but I'm sure that is no problem for you.

Alex Jones back again! You are a true patriot fighting for our general, Donald Trump. Now that we have gotten a foothold, it is time to put these globalists in their place. See that guy in the video? He is clearly rigging the election as we speak! What ever that website he has got there. That must be a weakspot, knowing how those liberals mishandle their tech, JUST like Crooked Hillary Clinton and her email servers. Did I mention how they got hacked? The globalist media keeps trying to hid that fact, but we know it will sink her in the end.

Anyway, what was I saying? Oh ya. You got to hack that webserver. Keep scouting with that IP camera, something must come up. They all suck at operation security, how else could Assange keep hacking them? Good luck, and don't forget to stay hydrated with your very own Alexapure Pro Water Filtration System (TM) to block out all the fluoride that is controlling your mind.

Tetrump Ultimate

Tetrump Ultimate just got released and everyone is playing it. Trump's campaign manager is a particularly avid player who sometimes watches replays at work. We need access to his computer. See if you can hack the game and get us in.

Correct The Record has created a new web browser which they are using to rig the election. To keep control of it, they are making it SaaS. They plan to force all the major browsers to use it, so that they can stifle free speech and cause Trump to lose the election. Hack into their server and put a stop to their evil plans.

Primaries

<p>
The first stage of any election are the primaries. Unfortunately, only entertainment figures registered for the ballot! See if you can get in and get some real candidates on there. Having a TV personality as President would be a disaster.

Trump Watch
</h2>

<p>
I think we have found an alt-right hotspot, in this blog which covers Trumps operations. Our reports show that they have been attacked a few times, and had their databases dropped. They seem to have beefed up security, but the admin still probably has some access to some interesting details.

Hint 1: Google is good at cracking hashes
Hint 2: /database.sql

No off the shelf automated tools are nedeed.

Voter Registration
</h2>

<p>
Trump is up quite a bit in Kansas, but with other historically red states (like Arizona) shifting sides, I think we can take this. Just takes a little voter fraud. Our target is the voter registration site, it looks like it is from the 90s, so it might be super vulnerable. If you can register a bunch of our people, we can bus them out and get them to vote for Clinton.

Just in Time
</h2>

<p>
Somebody broke into Kentucky's voter registration system last week but the officials are only saying that they patched it instead of saying who it was. Can you find a new way into their management system and identify the attacker? After registration closes, the site will be taken offline so don't miss your chance.
